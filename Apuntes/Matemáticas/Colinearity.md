# Caso

> "If I drew an _infinite_ straight line through points A and B, would the dot P be _somewhere_ on that line?"

# Fórmula

$$(Bx​−Ax​)(Py​−Ay​)=(By​−Ay​)(Px​−Ax​)$$

If it is true it means the point is in the line, else it is not.

# Ejemplo

Now plug in the numbers:
$A=(1,2)$
$B=(5,6)$
$P=(3,4)$

Let’s calculate both sides:

- Left side:  
$$(5−1)(4−2)=4×2=8$$
- Right side:  
$$(6−2)(3−1)=4×2=8$$
