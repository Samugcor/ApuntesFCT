## A command center for container management

The Docker command-line interface (Docker CLI) is a robust tool that empowers you to interact with Docker containers and manage different aspects of the container ecosystem directly from the command line. With the CLI, you can efficiently handle tasks such as creating, starting, stopping, and deleting containers, as well as managing container images, networks, and volumes. The Docker CLI provides a powerful and flexible option for managing containers and their resources.
