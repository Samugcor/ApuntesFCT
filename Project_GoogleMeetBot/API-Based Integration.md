1. **Host the Python Script as a Web API**
    
    - Deploy the script on a cloud platform (Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda, or a simple Flask app on Google App Engine).
        
    - Convert the script into an API that accepts requests (e.g., a Google Meet link) and triggers the automation.
        
2. **Create a Google Calendar Add-on (Apps Script)**
    
    - Develop a Google Workspace Add-on using **Google Apps Script**.
        
    - Add an interface (buttons, modals) where users can enable automation for a meeting.
        
    - When triggered, send a request to your hosted Python script (via **URL fetch API** in Apps Script).
        
3. **Automate Actions in Python**
    
    - The hosted Python script logs in, joins the Google Meet, records, and summarizes as per the repository logic.
        
    - Results (e.g., meeting summary) can be sent back to the user via email, Google Docs, or Google Drive.
