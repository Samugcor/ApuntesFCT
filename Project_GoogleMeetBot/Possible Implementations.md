### 1. **Google Workspace Add-on for Google Calendar:**

Developing a Google Workspace Add-on can integrate the bot's functionality directly into Google Calendar. This add-on can provide a seamless interface for users to schedule meetings with automatic recording and summarization features. By utilizing the Apps Script Card service, you can create custom interfaces that appear when users create or view events. This approach ensures that users can enable the bot's features without leaving the Calendar interface, enhancing usability and minimizing steps.

#### **Challenges**

- Google Apps Script does **not** allow running external scripts directly from Google Calendar or Meet. However.
- If the Python script is running on a server and using the same account as the user the Google Meet meeting will **not** be visible on the user's local machine.

#### **Workarounds**

- You can **trigger a remote API or server that runs your Python script**, [[API-Based Integration|more info]].
- Capture the video feed from the **Google Meet** session running in the headless browser and  **stream it live** to the user’s machine, [[Overview of Web Streaming|more info]].


### 2. **Chrome Extension for Google Meet:** 

A Chrome extension can overlay additional controls within the Google Meet interface, allowing users to activate the bot's recording and summarization features during live meetings. This method provides immediate access to the bot's functionalities without navigating away from the meeting window. However, this approach requires users to install the extension separately, which might add an extra step initially but offers convenience during meetings.​

### 3. **Google Chat Bot Integration:**

Integrating the bot as a Google Chat application can allow users to interact with it directly within Google Chat. Users can command the bot to join meetings, start recordings, and receive summaries through chat interactions. This method leverages the conversational interface of Google Chat, providing an intuitive way to control the bot's functionalities.

### 4. **Web Application with Google Calendar Integration:**

Developing a standalone web application that integrates with Google Calendar can offer users a centralized platform to manage meetings with the bot's features. Users can authenticate their Google accounts, and the application can fetch upcoming events, allowing users to select which meetings to record and summarize. While this approach requires users to access a separate platform, it can provide a comprehensive dashboard for managing recordings and summaries.
